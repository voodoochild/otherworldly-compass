    intro: `*You and your partners have been investigating strange events taking place in your home city of Arkham, Massachusetts. Over the past few weeks, several townspeople have mysteriously gone missing. Recently, their corpses turned up in the woods, savaged and half-eaten.

You are gathered together at the lead investigator’s home to discuss these bizarre events.*`,

The woman from your parlor follows you out the front door, slamming it behind her. “You fools! See what you have done?” She pushes a chair in front of the door, lodging it beneath the doorknob. “We must get out of here. Come with me, and I will tell you what I know. We are the only ones who can stop the threat that lurks beneath from being unleashed throughout the city.” You’re in no state to argue.

The fire spreads quickly, and you run out the front door to avoid being caught in the inferno. From the sidewalk, you watch as everything you own is consumed by the flames. “Come with me,” the woman says. “You must be told of the threat that lurks below.

    resolution_2__intro: `**Resolution 2:** *You refuse to follow the overzealous woman’s order and kick her out of your home for fear that she will set it ablaze without your permission. “Fools! You are making a grave mistake!” she warns. “You do not understand the threat that lurks below…the grave danger we are all in!” Still shaken by the night’s events, you decide to hear the woman out.

    intro_1: `*The woman came to you in a panic, raving about monsters emerging from the ground in a home near Rivertown. “I managed to trap them,” she explains, “but there are others. Other pits. Other domains.” Only last week, you would have thought she was a lunatic. Recent events, however, have challenged your preconceptions of normality. You decide to hear her out.*\n\r*She introduces herself as Lita Chantler and lays out a tale that strains the limits of your belief. “The creatures I speak of ,” she claims, “are called ghouls—cruel beings who plague the crypts, caverns, and tunnels beneath the city of Arkham…”*`,
    intro_2: `*In the wake of the disaster at your home, Lita Chantler, the red-haired woman from your parlor, lays out a tale that—even in light of what you have just witnessed—strains the limits of your belief. “The creatures in your home,” she claims, “are called ghouls—cruel beings who plague the crypts, caverns, and tunnels beneath the city of Arkham…”*`,
    intro_3: `*“These creatures feed on the corpses of humans, and they are served by a dark cult within Arkham whose members have inexplicably come to worship the ancient master of the ghouls. This cult has been killing innocent people and feeding them to the ghouls, satiating a monstrous hunger. A dark balance was maintained. Until now. Recently,” Lita continues, “one of their lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my best to stop them from running amok throughout the city. But I think there is something worse going on. The cult has been planning something darker, and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indications are that this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I cannot fathom what to expect.*\n\r*“Many of the cultists,” Lita continues, “will seem like everyday people, despite their foul intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped like the skulls of various animals to protect their identities from one another. These masks are our mark. Symbols of death and decay. We must unmask the cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours. The more cultists we find before midnight, the better.”*`,
